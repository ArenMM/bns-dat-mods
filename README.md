# Blade & Soul Data File Mods

This repository contains the data file mods I use for
[Blade & Soul](http://www.bladeandsoul.com). You will need
[BnS Buddy](https://github.com/RedDot-3ND7355/BnS-Buddy) to use these.

1. Add the files from this repository to your `addons` folder.
2. Tick the addons you want in BnS Buddy.
3. Select your client bitness (32-bit or 64-bit).
4. Play the game.

This should go without saying since it applies to using BnS Buddy in any
capacity, but using these mods is technically against the
[terms of service](http://us.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/blade-and-soul-user-agreement.php).
I'm pretty sure no one has ever gotten banned for using harmless mods like
these, but I take no responsibility if you do manage to get yourself banned
somehow.
