# Blade & Soul Data File Mods

This repository contains the data file mods I use for
[Blade & Soul](http://www.bladeandsoul.com). You will need
[BnS Buddy](https://github.com/RedDot-3ND7355/BnS-Buddy) to use these.

1. Add the files from this repository to your `addons` folder.
2. Tick the addons you want in BnS Buddy.
3. Select your client bitness (32-bit or 64-bit).
4. Play the game.
